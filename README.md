# Machine Learning Projects


This Repository serves as the central place for all Beginner-Level Machine Learning Projects implemeneted using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It contains all the Files and Datasets required to implement beginner-level Machine Learning Projects using Toy Datasets and serves as a good place for beginners to check out Machine Learning Projects and start implementing them.

## Projects

#### Predicting Emission using Fuel Consumption

Using the [Fuel Consumption Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sarita19/fuel-consumption) which consists of model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. Using <strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong> you have to predict the Emission.

#### Predicting House Price using Boston Dataset

Using the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) you have to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features in the Dataset using <strong>Multiple Linear Regression</strong>.

#### Predicting Breast Cancer

Using the [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) you have to predict if the tumour is benign or malignant, using <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>.

#### Predicting Diabetes

Using the [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) you have to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset, using <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>.

#### Hand-Written Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Network

Using the [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) you have to develop an <strong>Artificial Neural Network</strong> to predict Hand-Written Digits.

#### Predicting the Gender of a Person

Utilize <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, predict the Gender of a Person given their name. Use Natural Language Toolkit and the [Indian Names Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chaitanyapatil7/indian-names/version/1) to predict the Gender of a Person.

#### Classify the Image

Use [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10) to predict the class of the Object.
