## Multiple Linear-Regression!

### Getting Started

Whats is Regression?

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').
Regression is nothing but the Prediction.


When there is a single independent variable we call it simple linear regression.
when there are more than independent variables the process is known as Multiple Linear-Regression.

Data Type must be Numeric or Continuous.

There should be One dependent variable and multiple independent variables
The Linear relation between variables which is a relation between dependent and independent variables.
